# Instructions to Use App
Heroku is a cloud based service that allows the creation of apps. By connecting my Heroku project on GitHub, with all of the code, to Heroku, the user should be able to delopy the app.
1. Follow the link to my Heroku project: [Heroku Project](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/hello-heroku-moore)
2. Log in to Heroku (create account if user does not have one)
3. Once on the page, click the "Open App" button
4. The user should then be redirected to a new page showing the output of the app
