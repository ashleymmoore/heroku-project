# Instructions to Use App
Heroku is a cloud based service that allows the creation of apps. By connecting my Heroku project on GitHub, with all of the code, to Heroku, the user should be able to delopy the app.
1. Follow the link to my Heroku project: [Heroku Project](https://hello-heroku-moore.herokuapp.com/)
2. The user should then be redirected to a new page showing the output of the app
3. Open the index.js file in a text editor (it can be opened and changed within GitHub)
4. Edit line 6 ... if you put text within `<p></p>` tags (and the quotes), you can see your updates on the live URL page!
